# Coal-Mine-Surveillance-Bot-using-Thinkercad
By implementing a Coal Mine Surveillance bot, which can move around unmanned in the mine and detect the temperature level, fires we can prevent major accidents. We can even use the bot to detect any human presence at the restricted area. Components used Arduino UNO, Breadboard, 16*2 LCD display, Temperature sensor, Gas sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, PIR sensor, Piezo buzzer, Motor.
